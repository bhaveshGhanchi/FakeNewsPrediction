# FakeNewsPrediction

This repository contains a Python-based machine learning model that leverages logistic regression to accurately classify news articles as real or fake. The project utilizes a Kaggle dataset containing labeled news articles and employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful features from the text.

### Key Features:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset by removing stop words, stemming, and converting text to a numerical representation.
- Feature Extraction: Extracts relevant features from the text data, such as TF-IDF scores and word embeddings.
- Logistic Regression Model: Trains a logistic regression model on the extracted features to classify news articles as real or fake.
- Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/bhaveshGhanchi/FakeNewsPrediction.git`
2. Prepare data: Download the Kaggle dataset and place it in the data directory.
3. Run the model: Execute the `FakeNewsPrediction.ipynb` script to train and evaluate the model.
